This is a video game passion project that evolved from the question "what if I was forced to serve aliens hotdogs despite not understanding a word they say?"
This is a fully playable build (through the scene manager) though without sfx. All art and programming is done by me. 

For my own reference: 
Alien/customer generation is done on a per alien basis (see alien scenes), and level generation is done on a per queue basis (again see alien scenes) and the scaling is controlled by the scene manager
  --> this is the section (the alien scenes) that I'm the most proud of!

cheers
